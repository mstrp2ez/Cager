# Cager
Web based multiplayer game client

This is the web client for the multiplayer shooter game Cager. This was originally a game jam entry for a jam back in 2013 or 2012 that i
later picked up again and salvaged parts of for this version. 

The game runs over websockets via a seperate game server. The binaries and source for that server are not yet on git, but i'll make sure to 
add them at a later date.
